            Our commitment to artistry has always driven us to provide a platform that allows our customers to bring their creative passions to a wider audience.  That's especially the case for the music community; in the last few months, we launched audio collections and partnered with The Wild Honey Pie, Celebrate Brooklyn, Hertbreaker Banquet, Newport Folk Festival, and more.

            We're pleased to introduce a new partnership with Bandsintown that will further push the boundaries in bringing artists and audiences together.  Starting today, you can add a Bandsintown Block to your Squarespace website to seamlessly display your tour dates; any changes or updates you make to your tour schedule will instantly appear. It's also worth noting that you can add any band's tour schedule to your site; simply enter the artist's name and set the date range to display the tour information on a page or blog post.
